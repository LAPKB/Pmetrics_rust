\title{Load Pmetrics NPAG or IT2B output}
\usage{
PM_load(run, path = ".", file = "PMout.Rdata")
}
\arguments{
\item{run}{The numerical value of the folder in \code{path} containing run results}

\item{path}{include Path to the folder containing the raw results of the run. Default is the current working directory.
.}

\item{file}{Default is "PMout.Rdata", which is created after a Pmetrics run,
but it could also be the name of an .Rdata file created by running the
\verb{$save} method for a \link{PM_result} object.}
}
\value{
An R6 \link{PM_result}.
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable}{\figure{lifecycle-stable.svg}{options: alt='[Stable]'}}}{\strong{[Stable]}}
Loads all the data from a prior Pmetrics run.
}
\details{
A combination of \code{run}, \code{path}, and \code{file} are used to locate the results.
\itemize{
\item If \code{run} is provided, it is assumed that the results are in a subfolder
\verb{/outputs} of the folder named by \code{run} within the \code{path} folder.
\item If \code{run} is missing, the results are assumed to be in the \code{path} folder.
\item The \code{file} name is the name of the Rdata file containing the results.
Default is "PMout.Rdata", which is created by Pmetrics after a run.
\item If both \code{run} and \code{path} are missing, the current working directory is used
for \code{path}.
\item If both \code{run} and \code{file} are missing, the current working directory is used
for \code{path} and "PMout.Rdata" is used for \code{file}.
\item If both \code{path} and \code{file} are missing, the current working directory is used
for \code{path} and \code{run} is required.
\item If all three are missing, the current working directory is used for \code{path}
and "PMout.Rdata" is used for \code{file}.

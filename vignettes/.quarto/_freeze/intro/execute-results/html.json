This guide provides\ninstructions and examples to assist users of the Pmetrics R package, by\nthe Laboratory of Applied Pharmacokinetics and Bioinformatics at the\nSaban Research Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and the\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of\nSouthern California. Please see our website at\n[[http://www.lapk.org]{.underline}](http://www.lapk.org) for more\ninformation.\n\n## Rust \n\n**As of v. 3.0**, Pmetrics uses Rust for the core of the package and no longer\nuses Fortran. This is for several reasons, including the fact that Rust is a modern\nprogramming language that is more efficient and easier to maintain than Fortran.\nRust is memory safe, which means that it prevents common programming errors that can lead to\nmemory leaks and crashes. This makes it a more reliable choice for high-performance computing tasks.\nAdditionally, Rust has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it easier to work with\ndata and perform complex computations. This makes it a more flexible choice for a wide range of applications.\n\n## R6 architecture\n\n**As of v. 2.0**, Pmetrics uses an \"R6\" architecture less dependent on\nreading and writing files, preserving hard drive space and speeding execution, \nsince file I/O is slow. The goal is to simplfy work within a session by \neliminating the need to repeatedly copy and paste files from one folder to the next\nwhenever a new fit is executed. Storing critical objects in memory means they\ncan be used without accessing files. \n\nHowever, data and model files are still used for longer term storage\nand preserving work from one session to another. The format of those files,\nboth data and model, will be familiar to long term Pmetrics users.\n\nData files are generally .csv and the format is detailed in `vignette(\"data\")`.\nA model can be read from a text file or can be defined directly in R.\nThe easiest way to accomplish this is with our model builder app. Whether choosing\nto define models in R, with the builder app, or in a .txt file, details can be \nfound in `vignette(\"models\")`\n\n**Tips for using this guide.**\n\n* Items that are hyperlinked can be selected to cross reference\nwithin this manual or link to external sites.\n\n* `Items` correspond to inline examples of R code, which are not evaluated\nin this document, but serve as templates for what may be typed into your \nR console or script. They may not necessarily be executable if typed verbatim.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nYou, the user, assume all responsibility for acting on the results\nobtained from Pmetrics. The Laboratory of Applied Pharmacokinetics and\nBioinformatics (LAPKB), members and consultants to LAPKB, and Children's\nHospital Los Angeles and the University of Southern California and their\nemployees assume no liability whatsoever. Your use of the package\nconstitutes your agreement to this provision.\n\n## Installation\n\nPmetrics and all required components will run under Mac (Unix), Windows,\nand Linux. Instructions on obtaining and installing the package are in `vignette(\"pmetrics\")`.\n\n## What This Guide Is Not\n\nWe assume that the user has familiarity with population modeling and R,\nand thus this manual is not a tutorial for basic concepts and techniques\nin either domain. We have tried to make the R code simple, regular and\nwell documented. A very good free online resource for learning the\nbasics of R can be found at [Stat Methods](http://www.statmethods.net/index.html).\n\nWe recognize that initial use of a new software package can be complex,\nso please feel free to contact us at any time, preferably through the\n[Pmetrics Disussions](https://github.com/LAPKB/Pmetrics/discussions). You can report [issues](https://github.com/LAPKB/Pmetrics/issues) online as well.\n\nThis manual is also not intended to be a theoretical treatise on the\nalgorithms Pmetrics uses. For that, the user is directed to our\n[website](http://www.lapk.org/publications.php).\n\n## Getting Help and Updates\n\n\nWithin R, you can  use\n`help(\"command\")` or more simply just `?command` in the R console to see detailed help files for any Pmetrics command. Many commands have examples included in this documentation and you can execute the examples with `example(command)`.\n\nYou can also type `PMmanual()` to launch this website from within Pmetrics. \n\nPmetrics will check for updates automatically every time you load it\nwith `library(Pmetrics)` and you are connected to the internet. \nIf an update is available, it will provide a\nbrief message to inform you. You can then reinstall the package from github.\n\n<!--When bugs arise in Pmetrics, you may see a start up message to inform you of \nthe bug and a patch can be installed by the command `PMpatch()` if available. \nNote that patches must be reinstalled with this command every time you launch\nPmetrics, until the bug is corrected in the next version.\n-->\n\n<!--As of version 1.0.0 Pmetrics has graphical user interface (GUI)\ncapability for many functions. Using `PMcode(\"function\")` will launch the\nGUI in your default browser. While you are interacting with the GUI, R\nis \"listening\" and no other activity is possible. The GUI is designed to\ngenerate Pmetrics R code in response to your input in a friendly,\nintuitive environment. That code can be copied and pasted into your\nPmetrics R script. You can also see live plot previews with the GUI. All\nthis is made possible with the 'shiny' package for R.\n\n\nCurrently, the following GUIs are available: `PMcode(\"run\")` and\n`PMcode(\"plot\")`. \n--> \n\n<!-- ## Customizing Options\n\nYou can change global options in Pmetrics with \n`setPMoptions()`. The `getPMoptions()` function will return the \ncurrent options. -->\n",
